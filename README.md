# Documentation Page

This is my Github page where I will provide the documentation for my project.

I will also post pictures and transcribe my personal handwritten notes to this page as well. 



## **My project title will be "Feeling Cells‚Äù.**

My project will aim to understand and recreate _on a much larger scale_ the materials within a eukaryotic cell, 
and the cell itself so that it can be held and felt with human-sized hands. 


I have even cosidered what it might take to grow a living cell, rather than recreating a large synthetic version of 
a naturally occuring, microscopic, cell.

### **Things to do (tentative)**

- [ ] Research Building Living Cells
- [ ] Test Different Materials
- [ ] Create Graphics for Speculative Results
