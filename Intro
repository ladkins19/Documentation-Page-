This is my Github page where I will provide the documentation for my project.

I will also post pictures and transcribe my personal handwritten notes to this page as well. 



My tentative project title will be "Feeling Cells‚Äù.

My project will aim to understand and recreate on a much larger scale the materials within a eukaryotic cell, 
and the cell itself so that it can be held and felt with human-sized hands. 


I have even cosidered what it might take to grow a living cell, rather than recreating a large synthetic version of 
a naturally occuring, microscopic, cell.
